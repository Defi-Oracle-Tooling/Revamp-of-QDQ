# Governance Feature Extraction Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the incremental extraction of governance-related features from the `re-org-contracts` branch into focused feature branches for easier integration.

## Branches Created
- `governance/ssl-manager` - SSL/TLS certificate management
- `governance/backup-manager` - Backup and restore operations  
- `governance/health-monitor` - Health monitoring and alerting
- `governance/multi-cloud-provider` - Multi-cloud deployment support

## Integration Strategy
Each branch will contain:
1. Focused feature implementation from re-org-contracts
2. Integration TODOs and documentation
3. Clear merge strategy notes
4. Test coverage requirements

## Status
- [ ] SSL Manager: Extract enhanced SSL certificate provisioning
- [ ] Backup Manager: Extract automated backup/restore capabilities  
- [ ] Health Monitor: Extract network health monitoring features
- [ ] Multi-Cloud: Extract cloud provider abstraction layer

## Notes
- Each feature should integrate cleanly with current Mistress branch
- Maintain backwards compatibility where possible
- Add comprehensive tests before merging
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md
