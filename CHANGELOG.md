# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-14
## [0.5.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- **Config Refresh Flag**: Introduced `--refreshConfig` standalone CLI flag allowing integration configuration (environment + Azure Key Vault secrets) to be reloaded without providing required network flags (`clientType`, `privacy`).
  - Early argument interception executes before yargs validation when used alone.
  - Provides JSON summary (Wells Fargo enablement, base URL, Tatum testnet mode, timestamp).
  - Resets vault client + secret cache + config cache to reflect secret rotations.
  - Placeholder injection for `TATUM_API_KEY` in standalone mode to avoid hard failure during validation-only refresh.

### Changed
- **Entry Point Shim**: Added explicit `build/index.js` shim invoking `main()` from compiled `build/src/index.js` for backward compatibility with existing tooling and tests.
- **Version Bump**: Minor version increment from `0.4.0` to `0.5.0` due to new CLI capability.

### Documentation
- Updated root `README.md` with new "Configuration Refresh" section including example usage and output.
- Added `docs/operations/config-refresh.md` for deeper operational guidance, cache behavior, troubleshooting, and future enhancement notes.

### Tests
- Added Jest test `configRefreshFlag.test.ts` verifying standalone execution, exit code `0`, and presence of refresh summary keys.

### Internal
- Ensured early flag handling occurs prior to yargs required argument enforcement.
- Maintained invariant of non-overwriting existing output files; refresh path does not generate artifacts.

### Security & Safety
- Refresh summary excludes raw secret values (only high-level flags and derived booleans).
- Vault and config caches cleared explicitly to reflect secret rotations safely.


### Added
- **üåç Regional Topology Configuration**: Major new feature for multi-region Azure deployments
  - **Enhanced DSL Format**: `--azureRegionalDistribution "eastus:validators=3+rpc=2,westus2:archive=1"` for intuitive regional node specification
  - **JSON/YAML Configuration Files**: `--azureRegionalConfig` parameter for complex topology definitions with full regional customization
  - **Deployment Type Mapping**: `--azureDeploymentMap "validators=aks,rpc=aca,archive=vmss"` for flexible deployment strategy per node type
  - **Network Topology Modes**: Hub-spoke, flat, and mesh network configurations via `--azureNetworkMode`
  - **Hub Region Selection**: `--azureHubRegion` parameter for hub-spoke topology specification
  - **Member Node Types**: `--memberNodeTypes` for privacy network node type distribution

- **üìã Comprehensive Documentation**: 
  - Complete technical specification in `docs/regional-topology-specification.md`
  - Implementation roadmap with 3-phase development plan
  - Enhanced README with detailed regional topology examples
  - JSON/YAML configuration file examples with full regional distribution support

- **üß™ Comprehensive Test Suite**: 19 test cases covering all regional topology functionality
  - DSL parsing validation with edge cases and error handling
  - JSON configuration file loading and validation
  - Enhanced topology resolution with multi-region scenarios
  - End-to-end CLI integration testing

- **üîß Enhanced Core Interfaces**:
  - `RegionalNodeDistribution` interface for hierarchical region-based configuration
  - `EnhancedTopologyFile` interface supporting regional distribution strategies
  - `parseRegionalDistribution()` and `parseDeploymentMap()` functions for DSL processing
  - `resolveEnhancedAzureTopology()` function with fallback compatibility

### Technical Implementation
- **Extended NetworkContext**: Added 5 new parameters for regional topology configuration
- **Enhanced CLI Integration**: Full parameter integration with existing Azure infrastructure flags
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved with seamless fallback mechanisms
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and validation for all new features
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with descriptive messages for malformed configurations

### Examples
```bash
# Multi-region development network
npx quorum-dev-quickstart \
  --clientType besu \
  --azureRegionalDistribution "eastus:validators=3+rpc=2,westus2:validators=2+archive=1" \
  --azureNetworkMode hub-spoke

# Production network with JSON configuration  
npx quorum-dev-quickstart \
  --clientType besu \
  --azureRegionalConfig ./enhanced-topology.json
```

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- **Comprehensive AI Coding Agent Instructions**: Added detailed development guidance in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for consistent coding practices, feature addition workflows, and project-specific patterns
- **Renovate Configuration**: Added `renovate.json` for automated dependency updates with recommended settings
- **Enhanced Spinner Functionality**: 
  - Added status tracking (`running`, `success`, `fail`, `stopped`)
  - Added timing information for debugging slow operations (disabled in tests)
  - Improved cleanup and settlement logic to prevent race conditions
  - Better process exit handling with `once()` listeners to avoid memory leaks
- **Jest Test Framework**: Added Jest and @types/jest for comprehensive test coverage support
- **ESLint Configuration Modernization**: Updated ESLint config to be compatible with ESLint v9 and @typescript-eslint v8+

### Fixed
- **Dependency Security**: Updated `undici` from 5.23.0 to 5.26.3 to address security vulnerabilities
- **Lint Errors**: Fixed multiple ESLint violations including:
  - Shadow variable declarations in chainlink integration and network builder
  - Camelcase violations in monitoring dashboard (added explicit eslint-disable comments for API compatibility)
  - Max-classes-per-file violations in cloud provider and SSL manager modules
- **Build Compatibility**: Removed deprecated ESLint rules that were causing build failures

### Changed
- **Version Bump**: Updated from 0.2.1 to 0.3.0 to reflect significant feature additions
- **Test Script**: Added `test`, `test:watch`, `test:coverage`, and `test:ci` npm scripts for comprehensive testing workflows
- **Code Quality**: Enhanced code organization and maintainability through lint fixes and refactoring

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **ESLint Rule Cleanup**: Removed legacy rules (`ban-types`, `member-delimiter-style`, etc.) that are no longer available in current plugin versions
- **Package Dependencies**: Consolidated test-related dependencies and ensured compatibility with modern tooling

### Documentation
- **Development Workflow**: Comprehensive AI agent instructions provide clear guidance for adding features, maintaining code quality, and following project patterns
- **Build and Lint**: Updated documentation reflects new build process and lint requirements

### Notes
- This release focuses on infrastructure improvements, development experience, and technical debt reduction
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing generated networks
- The enhanced spinner provides better debugging information for slow operations during network generation
