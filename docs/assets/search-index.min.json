Table of Contents - Overview - Configuration Methods - Node Types and Subtypes - Network Topology Modes - CLI Parameters - Implementation Examples - Migration Strategy Overview The regional topology configuration system enables sophisticated multi-region Quorum network deployments with: - Per-region node type specification - Define different node types in each region - Network topology modes - Choose between flat, hub-spoke, or mesh architectures - Deployment type mapping - Map node types to specific Azure deployment types - Scalability configuration - Set scaling parameters per node type and region Current Architecture Analysis Existing Configuration Methods 1. Flat CLI Parameters: Basic region list with simple node counts 2. Placement DSL: Role-based deployment type and region mapping 3. JSON Topology Files: Structured configuration with enhanced regional granularity Previous Limitations (Now Resolved) - ❌ No per-region node type specification → ✅ Enhanced DSL format - ❌ Limited node subtype configuration → ✅ Comprehensive node specialization - ❌ Flat configuration without hierarchical planning → ✅ JSON topology files - ❌ No regional network topology awareness → ✅ Network topology modes Configuration Methods 1. Enhanced DSL Format (Recommended for Simple Cases) Format: Node Config: Supported Node Types: - - Consensus validator nodes - - RPC endpoint nodes (can be specialized) - - Network bootstrap nodes - - Archive/historical data nodes - - Member nodes for privacy networks - - Read-only observer nodes 2. Enhanced JSON Topology Format (Recommended for Complex Cases) 3. Interactive Regional Wizard Flow: 1. Select regions from Azure region list 2. Configure primary region designation 3. Specify node types per region with counts 4. Set deployment types and VM sizing 5. Configure network topology (flat/hub-spoke/mesh) 6. Review and confirm configuration Node Types and Subtypes Validator Node Subtypes - Primary: Full consensus participation with block production - Backup: Standby validators for automatic failover scenarios - Observer: Non-participating consensus observers for monitoring RPC Node Subtypes - Standard: Basic eth/web3 API access () - Admin: Administrative operations () - miner, admin namespace - Trace: Transaction tracing () - debugtraceTransaction - Debug: Advanced debugging capabilities - full debug namespace - Archive: Historical state access with full state history Member Node Subtypes (Privacy Networks) - Permissioned: Permissioned transaction processing with policy enforcement - Private: Private transaction capability with Tessera/Orion - Public: Public transaction processing only Archive Node Variants - Full: Complete blockchain history with all state - Pruned: Recent state with older state pruned - Snapshot: Fast sync with periodic snapshots Network Topology Modes Flat Network - All regions in single virtual network - Direct connectivity between all nodes - Best for: Low-latency requirements, ≤3 regions - Cost: Moderate (single VNet) Hub-Spoke - Central hub region with spoke regions - Traffic routed through hub region - Best for: Cost optimization with many regions - Requirements: Designated hub region Mesh Network - Full connectivity between all regions - Highest availability and performance - Best for: High availability requirements - Limitations: Cost scales quadratically, recommend ≤5 regions CLI Parameters New Regional Parameters | Parameter | Description | Example | |-----------|-------------|---------| | | Per-region node allocation DSL | | | | Node type to deployment mapping | | | | Path to enhanced JSON config | | | | Network topology mode | | | | Hub region designation | | Enhanced Existing Parameters | Parameter | Enhancement | Backward Compatible | |-----------|-------------|-------------------| | | Support new JSON schema | ✅ Yes | | | Regional RPC specialization | ✅ Yes | | | Enhanced parsing | ✅ Yes | Implementation Examples Multi-Region Development Network Production Network with Specialization Privacy Network Configuration High Availability Archive Network Validation Rules Regional Constraints - Minimum validators per region: 1 (for consensus participation) - Boot node distribution: Recommended across regions for resilience - Primary region requirement: Must contain ≥51% of total validators - Archive node redundancy: Recommended distribution across regions Network Topology Constraints - Hub-spoke: Requires designated hub region with adequate capacity - Mesh topology: Limited to 5 regions (cost optimization) - Flat network: Recommended for ≤3 regions due to complexity Resource Constraints - Total node count: Limited by Azure subscription quotas - Regional capacity: Varies by Azure region availability - Cross-region bandwidth: Consider network costs and latency Migration Strategy Backward Compatibility All existing parameters remain functional: - → Works as before - → Enhanced parsing - Legacy topology files → Supported with defaults Migration Steps From Flat Configuration From Basic DSL To JSON Configuration 1. Assessment: Analyze current parameter complexity 2. Translation: Convert DSL to structured JSON 3. Enhancement: Add regional-specific optimizations 4. Validation: Test enhanced configuration Advanced Features Auto-scaling Configuration Cost Optimization - Regional instance sizing: Automatic size recommendations per region - Network topology costs: Cost estimation for different topologies - Storage optimization: Intelligent storage type selection Performance Monitoring - Regional latency metrics: Cross-region communication monitoring - Consensus performance: Regional validator performance tracking - Resource utilization: Per-region resource usage analytics Troubleshooting Common Issues Regional Validation Errors Network Topology Conflicts Resource Quota Issues Debug Mode Performance Considerations Scaling Recommendations - Small networks (≤10 nodes): Single region with flat topology - Medium networks (11-50 nodes): 2-3 regions with hub-spoke - Large networks (50+ nodes): Multi-region mesh with archive distribution Cost Optimization Tips 1. Use hub-spoke topology for cost-sensitive deployments 2. Distribute archive nodes strategically based on access patterns 3. Right-size VM instances based on expected load 4. Consider regional pricing differences in Azure regions Future Enhancements Planned Features - Auto-scaling policies: Dynamic node scaling based on load - Cost estimation: Real-time cost calculation for configurations - Performance optimization: Automatic region selection based on latency - Disaster recovery: Cross-region backup and failover automation Experimental Features - Multi-cloud support: Support for AWS and GCP regions - Edge deployment: IoT and edge device integration - Advanced consensus: Regional consensus with global finality For additional information and examples, see: - CLI Reference - Complete CLI parameter documentation - Azure Services Integration - Azure-specific deployment guides - Deployment Guide - Production deployment strategies 📝 Edit this page**: Edit on GitHub","headings":[{"level":2,"text":"Table of Contents","id":"table-of-contents"},{"level":2,"text":"Overview","id":"overview"},{"level":3,"text":"Current Architecture Analysis","id":"current-architecture-analysis"},{"level":4,"text":"Existing Configuration Methods","id":"existing-configuration-methods"},{"level":4,"text":"Previous Limitations (Now Resolved)","id":"previous-limitations-now-resolved"},{"level":2,"text":"Configuration Methods","id":"configuration-methods"},{"level":3,"text":"1.

Guide","content":"Contributing Guide 🏠 Documentation Home → Docs → Development → contributing > Status: Active | Last Updated: 2025-10-14 | Version: 0.4.0 Welcome to the Quorum Dev Quickstart project! This guide covers everything you need to know to contribute effectively to the project. Table of Contents - Getting Started - Development Setup - Code Standards - Contributing Process - Testing Requirements - Documentation Guidelines - Release Process Getting Started Project Overview Quorum Dev Quickstart is a CLI tool that scaffolds local Quorum (Hyperledger Besu / GoQuorum) development networks. Our focus is on correctness, minimal surprise overwrites, and fast addition of new selectable features. Core Principles - Offline-first security model: Safe defaults with explicit opt-in for external services - Minimal scope control: Only modify files directly tied to the stated change - Template-driven architecture: Clean separation between logic and configuration - Backward compatibility: Maintain existing functionality while adding new features Architecture Highlights - Entry Point: → - Templates: use Nunjucks for variable substitution - Static Assets: for direct copying (no template syntax) - Client Split: Top-level and directories Development Setup Prerequisites - Node.js 16+ and npm - Docker and Docker Compose (for testing generated networks) - Git with configured user name and email Initial Setup Development Workflow IDE Configuration VSCode (Recommended) Code Standards TypeScript Guidelines - Strict mode enabled: Use proper type annotations - Target ES5: Maintain compatibility with older Node.js versions - No any types: Use proper interfaces and type unions - JSDoc comments: Document public functions and interfaces Example Interface File Naming Conventions - Source files: (e.g., ) - Test files: (e.g., ) - Configuration files: (e.g., ) - Documentation: (e.g., ) Code Organization Error Handling Standards - Always settle spinner: Call or before throwing - Descriptive error messages: Include context and suggested solutions - Early validation: Validate inputs before processing - Graceful degradation: Provide fallbacks where appropriate Example Error Handling Contributing Process Before You Start 1. Check existing issues: Look for related issues or discussions 2. Create an issue: For new features, create an issue to discuss approach 3. Fork the repository: Create your own fork for development 4. Create feature branch: Use descriptive branch names Branch Naming Convention - Features: (e.g., ) - Bug fixes: (e.g., ) - Documentation: (e.g., ) - Refactoring: (e.g., ) Pull Request Process 1. Prepare Your Changes 2. Commit Standards Use Conventional Commits: 3. Create Pull Request - Title: Clear, descriptive title matching commit convention - Description: Explain what changed and why - Link issues: Reference related issues with - Test evidence: Include test results and verification steps PR Template Code Review Process 1. Automated checks: Ensure CI passes (build, test, lint) 2. Peer review: At least one team member must review 3. Documentation review: Verify docs are updated appropriately 4. Testing verification: Confirm tests cover new functionality 5.

and Static Assets Review","content":"Templates and Static Assets Review 🏠 Documentation Home → Docs → Development → template-review Summary of Findings After reviewing and directories, the following issues and opportunities were identified: Templates () Current Structure Issues Found 1. Limited monitoring support: Templates only support and , but CLI now supports 2. Explorer handling: Uses separate and flags instead of unified option 3. Missing new variables: Templates don't leverage new CLI flags like: - and Azure-specific configurations - Enhanced node topology (, , , etc.) - New RPC configuration options - Genesis presets and consensus mechanism selection Recommendations 1. Add Loki support to both Besu and GoQuorum templates 2. Implement unified explorer logic using variable with fallback to individual flags 3. Add Azure deployment sections conditionally included when is true 4. Enhance node topology to support variable validator/RPC node counts 5. Add consensus-specific configurations based on variable Static Assets () Current Structure Issues Found 1. Duplication: Some configs exist in both and that could be in 2. Missing Azure assets: No Azure-specific configuration files or scripts 3. Outdated monitoring configs: Some monitoring configurations may not reflect latest versions Recommendations 1. Move shared configs to : - Shared smart contracts - Common monitoring configurations - Reusable scripts and utilities 2. Add Azure asset templates: - Azure Container Apps configurations - AKS deployment manifests - Parameter files for Bicep templates 3. Update monitoring versions: Ensure all monitoring stack versions are current Deduplication Opportunities High Priority - - Move shared contracts to - - Consolidate Prometheus configs - - Evaluate if configurations can be shared Medium Priority - Dockerfile templates that differ only in client type - Shared utility scripts and helpers - Common environment variable templates Template Variable Gaps The following NetworkContext variables are not yet utilized in templates: Missing in Templates - and all Azure-specific options - , , (dynamic node counts) - mechanism selection - for genesis configuration - for custom chain configuration - unified option (still using separate flags) - and - , , , etc. Implementation Plan Phase 1: Critical Updates 1. Add monitoring support to templates 2. Implement unified logic 3. Add dynamic node count support Phase 2: Enhancement 1. Add Azure deployment configurations 2. Move shared assets to 3. Add consensus mechanism templating Phase 3: Optimization 1. Full deduplication of shared assets 2. Version updates for all monitoring stacks 3. Enhanced smart contract examples Template Update Examples Loki Support Addition Unified Explorer Logic Dynamic Node Topology Validation Required Before implementing changes: 1. Test template rendering with all new variables 2. Verify Docker Compose syntax after changes 3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing deployments 4. Validate Azure-specific templates with actual deployment Dependencies Template updates depend on: - NetworkContext interface stability (completed) - CLI flag handling improvements (completed) - Topology resolution logic (completed) - Documentation updates (completed) 📝 Edit this page: Edit on GitHub","headings":[{"level":2,"text":"Summary of Findings","id":"summary-of-findings"},{"level":3,"text":"Templates (`templates/**`)","id":"templates-templates"},{"level":4,"text":"Current Structure","id":"current-structure"},{"level":4,"text":"Issues Found","id":"issues-found"},{"level":4,"text":"Recommendations","id":"recommendations"},{"level":3,"text":"Static Assets (`files/**`)","id":"static-assets-files"},{"level":4,"text":"Current Structure","id":"current-structure"},{"level":4,"text":"Issues Found","id":"issues-found"},{"level":4,"text":"Recommendations  ","id":"recommendations"},{"level":3,"text":"Deduplication Opportunities","id":"deduplication-opportunities"},{"level":4,"text":"High Priority","id":"high-priority"},{"level":4,"text":"Medium Priority  ","id":"medium-priority"},{"level":3,"text":"Template Variable Gaps","id":"template-variable-gaps"},{"level":4,"text":"Missing in Templates","id":"missing-in-templates"},{"level":3,"text":"Implementation Plan","id":"implementation-plan"},{"level":4,"text":"Phase 1: Critical Updates","id":"phase-1-critical-updates"},{"level":4,"text":"Phase 2: Enhancement","id":"phase-2-enhancement"},{"level":4,"text":"Phase 3: Optimization","id":"phase-3-optimization"},{"level":3,"text":"Template Update Examples","id":"template-update-examples"},{"level":4,"text":"Loki Support Addition","id":"loki-support-addition"},{"level":4,"text":"Unified Explorer Logic","id":"unified-explorer-logic"},{"level":4,"text":"Dynamic Node Topology","id":"dynamic-node-topology"},{"level":3,"text":"Validation Required","id":"validation-required"},{"level":3,"text":"Dependencies","id":"dependencies"}],"codeBlocks":[{"language":"text","content":"templates/\n├── besu/\n│   ├── config/\n│   └── docker-compose.yml\n└── goquorum/\n    └── docker-compose.yml"},{"language":"text","content":"files/\n├── besu/\n│   ├── README.md ✅ (updated)\n│   ├── config/\n│   ├── quorum-explorer/\n│   └── smart_contracts/\n├── common/ \n│   ├── Scripts ✅ (list.sh updated)\n│   ├── config/\n│   ├── dapps/\n│   ├── monitoring configs (loki/, splunk/, etc.)\n│   └── smart_contracts/\n└── goquorum/\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── config/ \n    ├── quorum-explorer/\n    └── smart_contracts/"},{"language":"yaml","content":"{% if monitoring == \"loki\" %}\n  loki:\n    image: grafana/loki:latest\n    # ... loki configuration\n{% endif %}"},{"language":"yaml","content":"{% if (explorer == \"blockscout\") or (explorer == \"both\") or (blockscout and not explorer) %}\n  blockscout:\n    # ... blockscout configuration  \n{% endif %}"},{"language":"yaml","content":"{% for i in range(validators or 4) %}\n  validator{{ i + 1 }}:\n    # ... validator node configuration\n{% endfor %}"}],"metadata":{},"stats":{"wordCount":472,"readingTime":3,"headingCount":24,"codeBlockCount":5},"lastModified":"2025-10-14T15:08:44.048Z"},{"id":"development-testing-strategy-md","filePath":"development/testing-strategy.md","url":"development/testing-strategy.html","title":"Testing Strategy: Regional Topology Configuration","content":"Testing Strategy: Regional Topology Configuration 🏠 Documentation Home → Docs → Development → testing-strategy Test Coverage Requirements Unit Tests (Target: 90% coverage) 1.

Branch Diff Summary","content":"Re-org-Contracts Branch Diff Summary 🏠 Documentation Home → Docs → Reference → contract-reorganization-summary Overview This document provides a comprehensive analysis of changes in the branch compared to the current branch, with rationales for each modification. Summary Statistics - 28 files changed: 228 insertions(+), 2217 deletions(-) - Major focus: Smart contract reorganization and removal of duplicated content - Impact: Primarily affects example contracts, scripts, and documentation File-by-File Analysis 1. Documentation & Configuration (+114 lines changed) Rationale: Updated documentation to reflect new smart contract organization structure and improved user guidance. Impact: Better developer experience with clearer setup instructions. Recommendation: Merge - Documentation improvements are valuable. 2. Smart Contract Reorganization Besu Smart Contract Structure Changes: - ** (moved from , +14 changes) - Rationale: Centralized key management across privacy and public contracts - Impact: Simplified developer workflow, reduced duplication - directory (consolidated scripts) - , , - Rationale: Logical grouping of privacy-related transaction scripts - Impact: Better organization, clearer separation of concerns - directory (consolidated scripts) - , , - Rationale: Logical grouping of public transaction examples - Impact: Easier navigation for developers learning different transaction types Common Smart Contract Assets (moved from to root): - and - - - Rationale: Shared assets between Besu and GoQuorum should not be duplicated - Impact: Single source of truth, easier maintenance 3. Cleanup & Deduplication Removed Files (Major deletions): - (-24 lines) - entire directory (-2000+ lines) - (-1938 lines) - (-20 lines) - (-20 lines) - (-70 lines) Rationale: Eliminated duplicate smart contract assets that were identical between Besu and GoQuorum. Impact: Significantly reduced codebase size, eliminated maintenance burden of keeping duplicates in sync. Recommendation: Merge - This is pure cleanup with no functional loss. 4. Template Updates (+8 changes) (+10 changes) Rationale: Updated docker configurations to reference new smart contract paths Impact: Ensures generated networks work with reorganized structure Recommendation: Merge - Required for reorganization to function 5. Package Management (+2 changes) Rationale: Version bump from 0.2.1 to 0.2.2 Impact: Reflects changes in this release Recommendation: Coordinate with current 0.3.0 version (+4 changes) Rationale: Updated lockfile to reflect package.json changes Impact: Ensures reproducible builds Recommendation: Regenerate based on current dependencies Integration Strategy ✅ Safe to Merge Immediately: 1. Smart Contract Deduplication: Pure cleanup, no functional changes 2. Directory Reorganization: Logical improvement to developer experience 3. Template Updates: Required for reorganized structure to work 4. Documentation Improvements: Valuable user experience enhancements ⚠️ Requires Coordination: 1. Version Numbers: Reconcile 0.2.2 bump with current 0.3.0 2. Lockfiles: Regenerate npm-shrinkwrap.json from current state 🔄 Recommended Integration Steps: 1. Phase 1: Merge smart contract reorganization (low risk) 2. Phase 2: Update documentation to reflect current features 3. Phase 3: Coordinate version numbers and regenerate lockfiles Risk Assessment Low Risk ✅: - Smart contract reorganization (no functional changes) - Directory structure improvements - Duplicate file removal Medium Risk ⚠️: - Template changes (require validation with generated networks) - Documentation updates (may reference features not yet in Mistress) Mitigation: - Test network generation after smart contract reorganization - Validate all template references point to existing files - Update documentation to match current Mistress feature set Conclusion The branch primarily contains valuable structural improvements and cleanup rather than new features. The changes reduce technical debt, improve developer experience, and eliminate maintenance overhead from duplicate files. Recommendation: Proceed with integration in phases, starting with the smart contract reorganization which provides immediate benefits with minimal risk. 📝 Edit this page**: Edit on GitHub","headings":[{"level":2,"text":"Overview","id":"overview"},{"level":2,"text":"Summary Statistics","id":"summary-statistics"},{"level":2,"text":"File-by-File Analysis","id":"file-by-file-analysis"},{"level":3,"text":"1.

Table of Contents - General Security Principles - API Keys and Credentials Management - Environment Variables - Network Security - Integration-Specific Security - Secret Rotation - Monitoring and Auditing General Security Principles Principle of Least Privilege - Grant minimal necessary permissions to each component - Use service accounts with restricted scopes where possible - Regularly audit and review permissions Defense in Depth - Implement multiple layers of security controls - Never rely on a single security mechanism - Combine network, application, and data-level security Secure by Default - All networks generate with secure defaults (offline mode for integrations) - External calls must be explicitly enabled via flag - Private keys and sensitive data are never logged or exposed API Keys and Credentials Management Storage - Never commit API keys to version control - Use environment variables or secure secret management systems - Store secrets in encrypted form when possible - Use different API keys for different environments (dev/staging/prod) Access Control - Limit API key permissions to minimum required scope - Use read-only keys where write access is not needed - Implement key rotation policies (see Secret Rotation) Example: Chainlink Integration Example: FireFly Integration Environment Variables Naming Conventions Use consistent, descriptive naming: - - Chainlink API access token - - FireFly authentication token - - OpenZeppelin Defender API key - - Azure service principal secret Validation - Validate all environment variables at startup - Fail fast if required secrets are missing - Use type checking for configuration values Environment Isolation Network Security Network Isolation - Use private networks and VPCs where possible - Implement proper firewall rules and security groups - Restrict RPC access to authorized IP ranges only TLS/SSL Configuration Port Security - Change default ports when possible - Use non-standard ports for administrative interfaces - Close unused ports and services Integration-Specific Security Chainlink Oracles - Use read-only API keys for price feed access - Validate feed data before use in smart contracts - Implement circuit breakers for anomalous data - Monitor for oracle manipulation attacks OpenZeppelin Defender - Use separate API keys for each function (Relayer, Sentinel, Admin) - Implement spending limits on relayer accounts - Monitor transaction patterns for anomalies - Use multi-signature wallets for admin actions FireFly Integration - Use namespace-specific tokens with minimal permissions - Implement message validation and sanitization - Monitor broadcast patterns for abuse - Use HTTPS endpoints only CREATE2 Factory - Validate deployment parameters before execution - Use deterministic salts based on known inputs - Implement access controls on factory contracts - Monitor for deployment front-running Secret Rotation Automated Rotation Implement regular rotation schedules: - API keys: Every 90 days - Database passwords: Every 30 days - TLS certificates: Automatic renewal 30 days before expiry - SSH keys: Every 180 days Rotation Process 1. Generate new credentials in the target system 2. Update environment configurations with new values 3. Deploy configuration updates using rolling deployment 4. Validate functionality with new credentials 5. Revoke old credentials after validation period 6. Update documentation and audit logs Example Rotation Script Monitoring and Auditing Security Monitoring - Monitor failed authentication attempts - Track API usage patterns and rate limits - Alert on suspicious network activity - Log all administrative actions Audit Logging Health Monitoring Integration Offline-First Security Model This toolkit implements an offline-first security model: Default Behavior (Secure) - All integrations use simulation/stub mode by default - No external API calls are made without explicit opt-in - Network generation is deterministic and reproducible - Sensitive operations require explicit flag activation Online Mode (Opt-in Only) Benefits - Development safety: No accidental API charges or rate limit exhaustion - Network isolation: Development networks don't leak to production services - Reproducible builds: Same configuration generates identical networks - Security by default: Opt-in model for potentially sensitive operations Emergency Response Incident Response Plan 1. Immediate containment: Revoke compromised credentials 2. Impact assessment: Identify affected systems and data 3. Communication: Notify stakeholders per incident severity 4. Recovery: Restore from secure backups if necessary 5. Post-incident review: Update security controls based on lessons learned Emergency Contacts - Security Team: security@your-org.com - On-call Engineer: +1-xxx-xxx-xxxx - Cloud Provider Support: [Provider emergency contact] Quick Response Commands Compliance and Frameworks Regulatory Considerations - Ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA) - Implement appropriate controls for financial services if applicable - Consider industry-specific security standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001) Documentation Requirements - Maintain security architecture documentation - Document all API integrations and their security controls - Keep incident response procedures up to date - Regular security control testing and validation Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regularly review and update these practices as your network and threat landscape evolve.
